Kerberos is a shared secret protocol, which means that tickets encrypted by the KDC can be decrypted only by clients or servers that have the shared secret.
To understand the Kerberos protocol, start with the concept of a Kerberos realm, which is a set of users and servers for which a given KDC is the authenticating authority.
A Kerberos principal is a workstation user ID and its associated password or a server ID and its associated password. 
The KDC stores the principals and their passwords. The principal names and IDs aren't stored on the individual machines in the realm.
Each principal provides a valid Kerberos ticket, which is authenticated before the request is processed. The KDC is the only place in a Kerberos realm where a ticket is created. 
Two kinds of tickets are used in the Kerberos protocol: ticket-granting tickets (TGTs) and STs. TGTs are obtained when a principal logs into (performs a "kinit") the Kerberos realm. Each user must obtain a TGT before using any server that performs Kerberos authentication.
