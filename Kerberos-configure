Instead of authenticating each user to each network service, Kerberos uses symmetric encryption and a trusted third party (a KDC), to authenticate users to a suite of network services.

kerberos-master.vivekyadavs.me - 192.168.1.51
kerberos-client.vivekyadavs.me - 192.168.1.52

Install the krb5-libs, krb5-server, and krb5-workstation packages on the dedicated machine which runs the KDC. This machine needs to be very secure â€” if possible, it should not run any services other than the KDC.

on MASTER

# yum update && yum install krb5-server krb5-workstation pam_krb5

on CLIENT

# yum update && yum install krb5-workstation pam_krb5


Once it is installed, edit the configuration files (/etc/krb5.conf and /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl) and replace all instances of example.com (lowercase and uppercase) with mydomain.com as follows.

# systemctl start krb5kdc kadmin nfs-secure   
# systemctl enable krb5kdc kadmin nfs-secure       

Now create the Kerberos database
# kdb5_util create -s
