Instead of authenticating each user to each network service, Kerberos uses symmetric encryption and a trusted third party (a KDC), to authenticate users to a suite of network services.

Install on kerberos-master.vivekyadavs.me
# yum -y install krb5-server krb5-libs

on kerberos-master.vivekyadavs.me
edit /etc/krb5.conf

Adjust /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf on the KDC:
Adjust /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl on KDC:

A keytab is a file used to store the encryption keys for one or more Kerberos principals (usually host and/or service principals). Given one of these keys it is possible to obtain a ticket-granting ticket, so having an encryption key can be equated to having a password. Whenever a host or service principal is created it is normal practice to add it to a keytab.
Kerberos hosts usually have a default keytab with the pathname /etc/krb5.keytab. The host principal should be added to this keytab, but it is not necessarily suitable for use with service principals. The reason is that /etc/krb5.keytab should be readable only by root, whereas on modern systems it is common for network services to execute as a non-root user. The only secure solution to this issue is to have multiple keytabs, each owned by the user that needs access to it.


ENABLE KERBEROS ON CLIENT SIDE
---------------------------------------------------------------------
install on kerberos-client.vivekyadavs.me
# yum -y install krb5-workstation krb5-libs 

Transfer your /etc/krb5.conf (which got created from above command) from the KDC server to the client. Hop onto the client server, install the Kerberos client package and add some host principals:

Principal FOR USERS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
kadmin:  addprinc username@MASTER.VIVEKYADAVS.ME 

Now on the KDC create a admin principal and also a test user (kerbuser):

kadmin.local:  addprinc root/admin
kadmin.local:  addprinc vivek/admin
kadmin.local:  addprinc kerbuser
kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab kadmin/admin
kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab kadmin/changepw



The meaning of those acl contents are that any account which ends with a /admin in the GNUD.IE realm is granted full access privileges.

Now that we've set up access for our administrative user, we need to create that administrative user.
The standard is to name the administrative account admin or root, i ll give as admin

test - 
$ kinit -p kerbuser@MASTER.VIVEKYADAVS.ME



Principal FOR Hosts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add HOST key for kerberos-client.vivekyadavs.me
kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey host/kerberos-client.vivekyadavs.me"


Enable SSH
Step1: Configuring SSH Server

Configure /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to include the following lines:

KerberosAuthentication yes
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
UsePAM no
Now, restart the ssh daemon.

Step2: Configure the SSH Client

Configure /etc/ssh_config to include following lines:

Host *.vivekyadavs.me
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
  GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes

TEST SSH , then Add service

Add service

kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey ssh/kerberos-client.vivekyadavs.me"
kadmin -q "getprinc HTTP/www.example.com"


Now TEST using SSH After kerberos restart

The daemons that must run on the server are krb5kdc and kadmin.

{Kerberos1}bash# /sbin/chkconfig krb5kdc on
{Kerberos1}bash# /sbin/chkconfig kadmin on
systemctl start krb5kdc.service
systemctl start kadmin.service
systemctl enable krb5kdc.service
systemctl enable kadmin.service

Add policies for different services and hosts

Set up kerberos on Redhat/CentOS 7
Raw  kerberos_setup.md
Installing Kerberos on Redhat 7
This installation is going to require 2 servers one acts as kerberos KDC server and the other machine is going to be client. Lets assume the FQDN's are (here cw.com is the domain name, make a note of the domain name here):

Kerberos KDC Server: kdc.cw.com
Kerberos Client: kclient.cw.com
Important: Make sure that both systems have their hostnames properly set and both systems have the hostnames and IP addresses of both systems in /etc/hosts. Your server and client must be able to know the IP and hostname of the other system as well as themselves.
Pre-Requisites:

Setup and install NTP

yum -y install ntp
ntpdate 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
systemctl start  ntpd.service
systemctl enable ntpd.service
RHEL 7 comes with systemd as the default service manager. Here is a handy guide for mapping service and chkconfig command here
Packages required:

KDC server package: krb5-server
Admin package: krb5-libs
Client package: krb5-workstation
Configuration Files:

/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf
/var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
/etc/krb5.conf
Important Paths:

KDC path: /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/
Installing & Configuring KDC Server:

yum -y install krb5-server krb5-libs
Primary configuration file is 'krb5.conf':

Ensure the default realm is set your domain name in capital case
Sample '/etc/krb5.conf'

[libdefaults]
    default_realm = CW.COM
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    dns_lookup_kdc = false
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    forwardable = true
    udp_preference_limit = 1000000
    default_tkt_enctypes = des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1
    default_tgs_enctypes = des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1
    permitted_enctypes = des-cbc-md5 des-cbc-crc des3-cbc-sha1

[realms]
    CW.COM = {
        kdc = kdc.cw.com:88
        admin_server = kdc.cw.com:749
        default_domain = cw.com
    }

[domain_realm]
    .cw.com = CW.COM
     cw.com = CW.COM

[logging]
    kdc = FILE:/var/log/krb5kdc.log
    admin_server = FILE:/var/log/kadmin.log
    default = FILE:/var/log/krb5lib.log
Adjust /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kdc.conf on the KDC:

default_realm = CW.COM

[kdcdefaults]
    v4_mode = nopreauth
    kdc_ports = 0

[realms]
    CW.COM = {
        kdc_ports = 88
        admin_keytab = /etc/kadm5.keytab
        database_name = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/principal
        acl_file = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl
        key_stash_file = /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/stash
        max_life = 10h 0m 0s
        max_renewable_life = 7d 0h 0m 0s
        master_key_type = des3-hmac-sha1
        supported_enctypes = arcfour-hmac:normal des3-hmac-sha1:normal des-cbc-crc:normal des:normal des:v4 des:norealm des:onlyrealm des:afs3
        default_principal_flags = +preauth
    }
Adjust /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.acl on KDC:

*/admin@CW.COM      *
Creating KDC database to hold our sensitive Kerberos data

Create the database and set a good password which you can remember. This command also stashes your password on the KDC so you don’t have to enter it each time you start the KDC:

kdb5_util create -r CW.COM -s
This command may take a while to complete based on the CPU power
Now on the KDC create a admin principal and also a test user (user1):

[root@kdc ~]# kadmin.local
kadmin.local:  addprinc root/admin
kadmin.local:  addprinc user1
kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab kadmin/admin
kadmin.local:  ktadd -k /var/kerberos/krb5kdc/kadm5.keytab kadmin/changepw
kadmin.local:  exit
Let’s start the Kerberos KDC and kadmin daemons:

systemctl start krb5kdc.service
systemctl start kadmin.service
systemctl enable krb5kdc.service
systemctl enable kadmin.service
Now, let’s create a principal for our KDC server and stick it in it’s keytab:

[root@kdc ~]# kadmin.local
kadmin.local:  addprinc -randkey host/kdc.cw.com
kadmin.local:  ktadd host/kdc.cw.com
Setup kerberos client

yum -y install krb5-workstation
Transfer your /etc/krb5.conf (which got created from above command) from the KDC server to the client. Hop onto the client server, install the Kerberos client package and add some host principals:

[root@client ~]# yum install krb5-workstation
[root@client ~]# kadmin -p root/admin
kadmin:  addpinc --randkey host/client.example.com
kadmin:  ktadd host/kdc.example.com
Raw  kerberos_ssh.md
Setting up SSH to use Kerberos Authentication
Pre-Req: Make sure you can issue a kinit -k host/fqdn@REALM and get back a kerberos ticket without having to specify a password.

Step1: Configuring SSH Server

Configure /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to include the following lines:

KerberosAuthentication yes
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
UsePAM no
Now, restart the ssh daemon.

Step2: Configure the SSH Client

Configure /etc/ssh_config to include following lines:

Host *.domain.com
  GSSAPIAuthentication yes
  GSSAPIDelegateCredentials yes
Note: make sure you change the domain to match your environment.

Thanks for the tutorial.
@shoubamzlibap
shoubamzlibap commented on Feb 24, 2015
Thanks. There seems to be small typo: when you add the principal on the client, there is an "r" missing from the command, and the option starts with just one dash (at least on my centos 7 box :smile: ). So the line would read something like

addprinc -randkey host/client.example.com

unicolet commented on Sep 11, 2015
 UsePAM no
in /etc/ssh/ssh_config is not necessary (unless you want to disable un-kerberized logins).
